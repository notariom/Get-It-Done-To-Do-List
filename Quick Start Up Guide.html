            <li><strong>Click the Checkbox:</strong>

            </li>
        </ol>

        </ol>

        <h2>4. Data Storage (Local Storage)</h2>
        <p>Your tasks are automatically saved in your web browser's **local storage**. This means if you close the browser tab or window and reopen the HTML file, your tasks will still be there.</p>
        <div class="note">
            **Important:** Local storage is specific to your browser and computer. Tasks saved on one computer or in one browser will **not** automatically sync to another.
        </div>

        <h2>5. Basic Troubleshooting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>**Tasks not appearing/saving?** Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser. This application relies on JavaScript to function.</li>
            <li>**Page looks strange?** Make sure the `Get It Done! To Do List CSS.css` file is in the same directory as the HTML file and hasn't been modified.</li>
            <li>**Buttons not working?** Check that the `Pencil.png` and `Trash.png` image files are in the same directory as the HTML file.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Notes for Users</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>**Independent Instances:** Each user will have their own independent "Get It Done! To-Do List." Tasks created by one user will **not** be visible to others.</li>
            <li>**Browser-Specific Data:** Each user tasks are tied to the specific browser you are using. If you switch browsers or computers, your tasks won't carry over.</li>
            <li>**Practice Focus:** Feel free to add, edit, and delete various tasks to get comfortable with the application's functionality!</li>
